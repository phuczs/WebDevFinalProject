                <p class="body-content">An aspiring author said seeing her novel become a bestseller after she went viral on social media was "a bit overwhelming" but "very exciting".</p>
                <p class="body-content">Vicky Ball, a former Suffolk school teacher who lives in Colchester, Essex, proudly posted on X after selling two of her books at an event in Chelmsford.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Since then the post has garnered more than 24 million views, been shared 31,000 times and received over 740,000 likes from people across the globe.</p>
                <p class="body-content">As a result of the extra attention, one of the 48-year-old's books, Powerless, shot up Amazon's teen and young adult fiction chart â€“ much to her surprise.</p>

                <p class="body-content">Mrs Ball, who works at the University of Essex, said: "I sold two books, which I was really happy about, because sometimes I've had book events where I don't sell any.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"So, I just posted it on X and thought nothing of it and left it. But then a few days later I woke up and checked my phone and it was going a bit crazy.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"I was completely surprised really and it was all a bit overwhelming - I was just amazed and couldn't believe it."</p>
                <p class="body-content">Mrs Ball, who has always enjoyed writing and "loves creating new stories", finished her first novel during lockdown before landing a small publishing deal.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Powerless is a thriller filled with "lots of twists" about a missing girl who returns home, while her second book Abandoned centres on an alcoholic mum with a dark secret.</p>

                <p class="body-content">Since becoming a viral sensation, copies of her debut offering have been purchased by book-lovers from all over the world, including America, Belgium and Columbia.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"It's been so lovely reading all the messages of support and it's been generally very positive, the majority of the people have been really happy for me," she added.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"Social media can be a really positive place, especially on X because there's a big writing community and we are very supportive of each other.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"I am quite happy at the moment doing a master's in creative writing and working at the university, but I have some ideas for some other books in the pipeline."</p>
