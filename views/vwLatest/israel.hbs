                <p class="body-content" style="font-weight:bold;">Israel will close its embassy in Dublin over "the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government", its foreign minister has said.</p>
                <p class="body-content">He added that the decision followed Ireland's announcement of its support for South Africa's legal action against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the country of "genocide".</p>
                <p class="body-content">Mr Saar said: "The actions and anti-Semitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the de-legitimisation and demonisation of the Jewish state, along with double standards.</p>
                <p class="body-content">"Israel will invest its resources in advancing bilateral relations with countries worldwide according to priorities that also take into account the attitudes and actions of these states toward Israel."</p>

                <p class="body-content">Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin has said there are no plans to close its embassy in Israel.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Martin said he had been informed by the government of Israel of its decision to close its embassy in Dublin.</p>
                <p class="body-content">He said: "I believe firmly in the importance of maintaining diplomatic channels of communication and regret that this decision has been taken."</p>
                <p class="body-content">"Ireland's position on the conflict in the Middle East has always been guided by the principles of international law and the obligation on all states to adhere to international humanitarian law."</p>
                <p class="body-content">He said the continuation of the war in Gaza and the "loss of innocent lives is simply unacceptable and contravenes international law."</p>
                <p class="body-content">He added: "It represents the collective punishment of the Palestinian people in Gaza. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza."</p>
                <p class="body-content">Mr Martin said Ireland and Israel will continue to maintain diplomatic relations, adding: "Inherent in that is the right to agree and disagree on fundamental points.</p>
                <p class="body-content">On 7 October last year, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.</p>
                <p class="body-content">In retaliation, Israel launched a massive operation inside the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.</p>
                <p class="body-content">So far, at least 44,875 people have been killed and more than 100,000 injured - mostly civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN regards these figures as reliable.</p>
