                <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 10px; padding-bottom: 1rem; font-weight:lighter;" >President-elected Donald Trump (on the rightmost) with future Vice President JD Vance (on the leftmost) joined Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old United States Marine Corps veteran, who killed a homeless man named Jordan Neely.</p>
                <p class="body-content">ABC News has agreed to pay $15m (Â£12m) to US President-elect Donald Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor falsely said he had been found "liable for rape".</p>
                <p class="body-content">George Stephanopoulos made the statements repeatedly during an interview on 10 March this year while challenging a congresswoman about her support for Trump.</p>
                <p class="body-content">A jury in a civil case last year determined Trump was liable for "sexual abuse", which has a specific definition under New York law.</p>
                <p class="body-content">As part of Saturday's settlement, first reported by Fox News Digital, ABC will also publish a statement expressing its "regret" for the statements by Stephanopoulos.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 10px; padding-bottom: 1rem; font-weight:lighter;" >George Stephanopoulos repeatedly made the false statement in an interview in March.</p>
                <p class="body-content">According to the settlement, ABC News will pay $15m as a charitable contribution to a "Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past".</p>
                <p class="body-content">The network also agreed to pay $1m towards Trump's legal fees.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Under the settlement, the network will post an editor's note to the bottom of its 10 March 2024 online news article about the story.</p>
                <p class="body-content">An ABC News spokesperson said in a statement the company was "pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing".</p>
                <p class="body-content">In 2023, a New York civil court found Trump sexually abused E Jean Carroll in a dressing room at a department store in 1996. He was also found guilty of defaming the magazine columnist.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Judge Lewis Kaplan said the jury's conclusion was that Ms Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her "within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law".</p>
                <p class="body-content">Judge Kaplan noted that the definition of rape was "far narrower" than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries and in criminal statutes elsewhere.</p>
                <p class="body-content">In a separate case, also presided over by the same judge, a jury ordered Trump to pay $83.3m to Ms Carroll for additional defamatory statements.</p>
                <p class="body-content">The anchor falsely said "judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape".</p>
                <p class="body-content">Stephanopoulos repeated the claim 10 times throughout the broadcast.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Ahead of the ruling, a federal magistrate judge had ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to give sworn evidence at depositions next week.</p>
                <p class="body-content">Trump has also sued CBS, the BBC's US broadcast partner, for "deceptive conduct" over an interview with Kamala Harris.</p>
                <p class="body-content">In 2023, a judge threw out his defamation lawsuit against CNN, in which he alleged the network had likened him to Adolf Hitler.</p>
                <p class="body-content">He has also had lawsuits filed against the New York Times and the Washington Post dismissed.</p>
